# Linkedlist-Bootcamp

### Singly LinkedList (Basics)

- Linked list Introduction
- Find the length of the linked list
- Search an element in a linked list
- Convert a List/Array to a Linked list
- Delete the head of the linked list
- Delete the tail of the linked list
- Delete the kth element of the linked list
- Insert at the head of the linked list
- Insert at the tail of the linked list
- Insert before the Kth element of the linked list
- Insert before the node with the value X of the linked list

### Doubly LinkedList (Basics)

- Introduction to DLL
- Deletion of the head of DLL
- Deletion of the tail of DLL
- Deletion of the Kth node of DLL
- Deletion of the given node of DLL
- Insertion before the head of DLL
- Insertion before the tail of DLL
- Insert before the Kth node of DLL
- Insert before a given node of DLL
- Insert after the end of the given node
- Reverse a DLL

### Linkedlist (Medium)

- Add 2 numbers in LL
- Segregate odd and even nodes in LL
- Sort a LL of 0's and 1's by changing the links
- Remove the nth node from the back of the LL
- Reverse a Linked List(Iterative)
- Reverse a Linked List(Recursive)
- Check if LL is palindrome or not
- Add 1 to a number represented by a linked list
- Find the intersection point of the linked list

### Linkedlist Tortoise and Hare Algo

- Middle of a linked list
- Detect a loop in a linked list
- Find the starting point in the linked list
- Length of the loop in the linked list
- Delete the Middle Node of the linked list

### Doubly Linkedlist (Medium + Hard)

- Delete all occurrences of a key in DLL
- Find pairs with a given sum in DLL
- Remove duplicates from sorted DLL

### Linkedlist (Hard)

- Sort linked list
- Reverse LL in group of size K
- Rotate a LL
- Flattening of LL
- Clone a LL with random and next pointer
